## Contributing

See the [roadmap]() and read a little about [what ST is, and is not]().

### Customising

We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for our styles, if you'd like to change the default styling please fork the repository and [make changes to the Sass](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/wiki/Customising-the-default-styling) before recompiling.

### Custom blocks

Block Types can also easily be added to the ``SirTrevor.Blocks`` object. You can also override the defaulty block types (Text, Image, Tweet, Video, Quote, Heading & List) at any time. Please see the Wiki article about [adding your own block types](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/docs.html#4) for more information.

### Compiling

We use the awesome [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for our build process. Before getting started please be sure to install the necessary dependencies via npm:

``$ npm install``

When completed you'll be able to run the various grunt commands provided:

``$ grunt``

Concatenates scripts, compiles the Sass, runs the Jasmine tests and minifies the project.

``$ grunt watch``

Convenience method while developing to compile the Sass files and concatenate the Javascript on save of a file in the ``/src`` directory.

Please ensure any pull requests have relevant Jasmine tests (where applicable).
