# What is Sir Trevor?

Sir Trevor provides a means to transform a text input into a rich content editor that's been re-imagined for the web. The content of the editor is stored as markdown inside a JSON object, with the structure and the contents of the post serliazed inside of it.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Sir Trevor is with [Bower](), the front-end package manager from Twitter. If you do use Bower, your `bower.json` file should look something like this:

    {
      name: "your-project",
      dependencies: {
        "sir-trevor-js": "0.3.0"
      }
    }

Then run `bower install` on your project to install the necessary dependencies.

Alternatively, grab the following files and include them in your project:

  * jQuery
  * Underscore.js
  * Eventable
  * Sir Trevor JS

And you'll need the following CSS files too:

  * Sir Trevor
  * Sir Trevor Icons

## Initialising

A Sir Trevor element must be contained inside a form like follows:

    <form>
      <textarea class="js-st-instance"></textarea>
    </form>

Then to transform this element to a Sir Trevor instance:

    <script>
      new SirTrevor.Editor({ el: $('.js-st-instance') });
    </script>
