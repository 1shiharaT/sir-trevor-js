# Sir Trevor To Do

1. Uploader to return promises
2. Keep a queue on each block of Async re quests (uploads etc)
3. On removal of a block, cancel any in progress requests and then  remove it. (Fixes issue with deleting will upload is in progress)
4. Revisit setData, toData, loadData, and getData.
5. Validations as an array (see [issue #21](https://github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/issues/21))
